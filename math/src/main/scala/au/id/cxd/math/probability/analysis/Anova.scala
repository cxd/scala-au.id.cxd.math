  *
  * This class implements an Anova procedure as derived from 'Mathematical Statistics with Applications' 7th edition by Wackerly, et el.
  *
  * That resource provides a full explanation, however a summary is given below.
  *
  * The goal of Anova is to "identify the important independent variables and determine how they affect the response".
  *
  * Where each independent variable is a factor and the intensity of the variable the level.
  *
  * The procedure calculates the Total Sum of Squares which is the sum of the squared deviations of each
  * variable from the mean and a remainder random error.
  *
  * We consider that under the null hypothesis the independent variables are assumed to be unrelated
  * to the response variable, and each portion of the total sum of squares divided
  * by a corresponding constant provides an independent and unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$ of the
  * experimental error.
  *
  * If a variable is highly related to the response its contribution to the total sum of squares
  * will be large.
  *
  * The variable sum of squares total $SST$ is compared with the sum of squares for the error $SSE$
  *
  * An F test is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.
  *
  * This implementation addresses the case for $k$ variables, and is used to determine
  * the F test for the null hypothesis $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_k$ and common variance $\sigma^2$.
  *
  * In this case we are working with matrices provided by the breeze library, at this time.
  * However, it would be useful to later change the implementation to use another structure
  * which allows uneven lengths of samples, since the number of rows for each sample will be equal in the matrix form.
  *
  * It is possible however to use unqual sample sizes for each $ith$ sample.
  *
  * An [[AnovaTable]] is used to contain the variables for the anova process
  * providing a "one way layout" that comprises of the following elements.
  *
  *
  * The total sum of squares is computed form the $SSE$ and the $SST$
  *
  * $$
  * TotalSS = \sum_{i=1 \in k} \sum_{j=1 \in n_i} (Y_{ij} - \bar{Y})^2
  * $$
  *
  * It can be summarised as being the total of all observations squared subtracting the correction for the mean $CM$
  *
  * $$
  * \sum_{i=1 \in k} \sum_{j=1 \in n_i} Y_{ij}^2 - CM
  * $$
  *
  * where the correction for the mean is calculated as the total for all observations squared divided by $n$
  *
  * $$
  * CM = \frac{1}{n} ( \sum_{i=1 \in k} \sum_{j=1 \in n_i} Y_{ij} )^2
  * $$
  *
  * The total of each sample set is defined as $Y_{i.}$:
  *
  * $$
  * Y_i. = \sum_{j=1 \in n_i} Y_{ij}
  * $$
  *
  * and the mean of each sample set is estimated as $\bar{Y_{i.}}$.
  *
  * $$
  * \bar{Y_{i.} } = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1 \in n_i} Y_{ij}
  * $$
  * $$
  * \frac{1}{n_i} Y_{i.}
  * $$
  *
  * This is used in calculating the Sum of squares for treatments which will be large if the
  * differences between the treatments is also large.
  *
  * $$
  * SST = \sum_{i=1 \in k} n_i (\bar{Y_{i.}} - \bar{Y})^2
  * $$
  *
  * Note also that ${Z\ squared} = \frac{SST}{{\sigma^2}}$
  *
  * having a $\chi^2$
  *
  * distribution with $k-1$ df for $k$ factors.
  *
  * $$
  * SST = \sum_{i=1 \in k} \frac{Y_{i.}^2}{n_i} - CM
  * $$
  *
  * The second part the sum of squared errors is computed as
  * $$
  * SSE = Total SS - SST
  * $$
  *
  * However it can also represent a total of the sample variances multiplied by a degree of freedom as shown in Wackerly.
  *
  * $$
  * SSE = \sum_{i=1 \in k} (n_i - 1) S_i^2
  * $$
  *
  * where the sample variance $S^2$ is
  *
  * $$
  * {S&#94;2} = \frac{1}{n_i-1} \sum_{j=1 \in n_i} (Y_{ij} - \bar{Y_{i.}})^2
  * $$
  *
  * which is an unbiased estimator of $ \sigma_i&#94;2 = \sigma&#94;2 $
  *
  *
  *
  * The Mean squared error is an estimator for the pooled variance $S&#94;2$
  * with $n-k$ degrees of freedom.
  *
  * $$
  * MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-k}
  * $$
  *
  * The Mean square total is accumulated from the estimates of the mean for each sample with degree of freedom $k-1$.
  * $$
  * MST = \frac{SST}{k-1}
  * $$
  *
  * Once the anova table is calculated the F-Test is used to test the null hypothesis
  * $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = ... = \mu_k$ with even variance, and is rejected at
  * the critical level $\alpha$
  *
  * $$
  * F = \frac{MST}{MSE} > F_\alpha
  * $$
  * The statistic is an F distribution with $k-1$ and $n-k$ numerator and denominator degrees of freedom.
  *
  * The key assumptions are the normal assumption for the $k$ samples, with equal means and variance.
  *
  * __Example Usage__
  *
  * The example is derived from the test case TestAnovaInference which is also derived from an
  * example in Wackerly on page 671.
  *
  * The test data for the example is the following matrix with $k = 4$ sets of observations.
  *
  * {{{
  *   /**
  * columns correspond to k samples
  * rows correspond to sample observation Y_ij
  * */
  * val table = DenseMatrix(
  * (65.0, 75.0, 59.0, 94.0),
  * (87.0, 69.0, 78.0, 89.0),
  * (73.0, 83.0, 67.0, 80.0),
  * (79.0, 81.0, 62.0, 88.0),
  * (81.0, 72.0, 83.0, 0.0),
  * (69.0, 79.0, 76.0, 0.0),
  * (0.0, 90.0, 0.0, 0.0))
  * }}}
  *
  * Note that incomplete examples have been padded with 0.
  * In this implementation it would be best to use a "balanced" set of samples where the number for
  * each observation is equal.
  *
  * The Anova table is created as
  *
  * {{{
  *   val anova = Anova(table)
  * }}}
  *
  *
  * And a test for the null hypothesis at the critical level for $\alpha = 0.05$ to be performed using
  *
  * {{{
  *   val testResult = anova.test(0.05)
  * }}}
  *
  * The test result will contain the anova table which can be printed or inspected for each of the table values.
  * Inspecting the table will give a report for example:
  *
  * {{{
  *      NumeratorDF: 3
  * DenominatorDF: 24
  * SST: 2876.107142857145
  * SSE: 23604.857142857145
  * MSE: 983.5357142857143
  * MST: 958.7023809523816
  * TotalDF: 27
  * TotalSS: 26480.96428571429
  * F-stat (observed statistic): 0.9747509592456765
  * F-alpha (critical value): 3.0000000000000013
  * P-Value: 0.4219003172019309
  * Observed-Prob 0.44613162513336035
  * alpha (significance level):0.05
  *
  * }}}
  *
  * In this example the F-stat > F-alpha and the test case rejects the null hypothesis.
  *
  * The test result also has the "rejected" flag which indicates whether the null hypothesis is rejected.
  * It is possible to use a $k$ fold approach to determine which of the samples may be rejected after the initial test.
  *
  * The critival value is approximated using the trait [[CriticalValue]] for the [[UpperTail]]
  * of the [[FDistribution]].
